Ok so hello guys.
Today I will show you how to deploy your discord bot to heroku

First of all let's make sure our server is running
Now we need to make a github repository
Push the code to github
Now let's create our heroku app ( make sure you are logged in on heroku and your app name is lowercase )
We can connect our github repo to heroku either via  heroku cli or much simpler by connecting directly to github
I will use the github connection method
Copy your repo name : https://github.com/Mxk01/YT-bot-deploy  E.g here it is  YT-bot-deploy
Click connect

Click deploy branch
Now let's create a procfile
Simply create a new file ( no extension and type in  web: node server.js  or whatever your file name is )
This will help heroku run our application  then commit our changes ( after making the procfile )
On free dynos make sure this button is checked
If you want to learn more about dynos check this article : https://dev.to/milandhar/what-are-heroku-dynos-3b1p
Let's see if our application is running
