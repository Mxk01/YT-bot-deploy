Ok so hello guys.
Today I will show you how to deploy your discord bot to heroku

First of all let's make sure our server is running
Now we need to make a github repository
Push the code to github
Now let's create our heroku app
We can connect our github repo to heroku either via  heroku cli or much simpler by connecting directly to github
Click deploy branch
Now let's create a procfile
This will help heroku run our application  then commit our changes
